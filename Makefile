# Transitional shim: gridctl now uses Task (https://taskfile.dev) as its task
# runner. Tasks live in Taskfile.yml; run `task --list` for the catalog. This
# shim forwards the old make targets to their task equivalents so existing
# muscle memory and older instructions keep working. It will be removed after
# a two-release sunset.
#
# Install task:
#   brew install go-task/tap/go-task
#   npm install -g @go-task/cli
#   go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

# $(1) is the task name; command-line variable overrides (PORT=, FILE=) pass
# through via MAKEOVERRIDES, both as Task variables and as environment (make
# exported overrides into recipe environments, so e.g. `make build-go
# GOOS=linux` keeps working). Values containing spaces are not supported by
# the shim; call task directly for those.
