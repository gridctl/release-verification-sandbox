# Packs

A pack is a git repository carrying a `gridctl-pack.yaml` manifest at its root: a versioned selector over the repo's skills, agents, rule fragments, and gateway wiring, so one import configures a whole team setup. Packs are a thin composition layer — `pack add` runs the same origin pipeline as `gridctl skill add` for skills and agents (security scan, `--trust` gate, drift-safe updates); rule fragments get the same blocking scan and `--trust` gate, and `pack add` refreshes a rule whose content changed upstream, provided you have not edited it locally. A rule you have edited is reported as locally modified and left alone; take the pack's version with `gridctl ctx rm <name>` followed by `pack add`, which discards your copy. Rules installed before gridctl recorded per-rule provenance are treated as locally modified until their next `pack add` records it. `skill update` still does not cover rules; `pack add` is their update path. `pack apply` drives the same projection engines as `gridctl skill project sync` (see the [Skills guide](skills.md)), `gridctl ctx sync` (see [Global Context Sync](global-context.md)), and `gridctl project sync --kind wiring`, scoped to the pack. Every projection a pack applies is tagged with the pack name in `~/.gridctl/project.lock.yaml`, which is what makes `pack status` and cascade removal exact. Per-command flags and exit codes are in the [CLI reference](cli-reference.md#packs).

## Manifest

```

`gridctl.dev/v1alpha1` is the pre-1.0 spelling of the same schema and stays accepted indefinitely, so packs authored before the graduation import unchanged; write `gridctl.dev/v1` in new manifests.

Skills follow the `SKILL.md` convention and agents the `agents/*.md` convention, exactly as plain skill repos do — a pack repo is a skill repo plus a manifest. Rule fragments live under `rules/*.md` or `fragments/*.md` (filename base is the fragment name). Names the manifest selects but the repo does not ship are reported as `unresolved` (exit 1) and kept in the pack record so status stays honest. Unlike skills/agents, an empty `rules:` list means **none** (rules are opt-in). A rule whose name collides with a local fragment of different content is skipped, never overwritten; identical content installs idempotently. A first rule install that activates fragments mode migrates AGENTS.md with an explicit printed message, exactly like `ctx add`.

Field names follow the Claude Code plugin.json family where the semantics match, so a pack maps onto that ecosystem rather than fighting it. The word "bundle" is deliberately avoided: the MCP ecosystem uses it for `.mcpb`, a single-server archive format.

The optional `variables:` map uses the same value-free declaration fields as
`stack.yaml`: `required`, `secret`, `type`, `description`, and `docs`, with
defaults of false, true, and string for the first three fields. Import records
the declarations and lists unmet required keys with `gridctl var set KEY`
commands. It never imports a value, edits a stack, writes the variable store,
or prompts. Packs without declarations retain the version-two lock shape;
version three is used only when declarations must be represented.

## Verbs

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gridctl pack add <repo-url>` | Clone, read the manifest, and import exactly its selection into the registry (`--ref`, `--path`, `--trust`, `--dry-run`, `--format json`). `--path` scopes discovery to a subdirectory, matching the REST `path` field; the manifest is always read from the repository root. Auth flags for private repos: `--vault-key <key>`, `--auth-token-stdin`, `--auth-token <pat>`, `--ssh-key <path>`. Registry-side only. Exit `0` clean, `1` partial (unresolved or skipped), `2` infrastructure. |
| `gridctl pack apply <name>` | Project the pack: skills and agents through the projection engines, rule fragments through `ctx` (pack-tagged), and (when `wiring: true`) the gateway entry through the wiring ownership manager, scoped to `clients:`. Additive, never transactional: each resource succeeds or skips independently (`Applied N/M` summary), drifted resources skip with an adopt/`--force` hint, a resource tagged by a different pack is refused, and wiring skips with a hint when no gateway is running. `--force`, `--dry-run`, `--clients`, `--format json`. |
| `gridctl pack status [name]` | Per-resource state in the shared vocabulary (in-sync, stale, drifted, target-missing, foreign, missing) plus `unresolved` rows. Exit `0`/`1`/`2`. |
| `gridctl pack remove <name>` | Cascade removal in dependency order: projections unsynced from client trees (rule fragment projections by pack tag only), wiring records removed through the ownership manager (entries gridctl did not record are never deleted), then the pack's registry skills, agents, and installed fragments, then the pack record. Drifted projections are kept with a remediation hint unless `--force`; a partial removal trims the pack record to what stayed. `--dry-run`, `--format json`. |

## Private pack repositories

A pack is a git repository, so a private one needs credentials the same way an imported skill source does. `gridctl pack add` takes the same flags as `gridctl skill add`:

- `--vault-key <key>`: resolves the token from a `${var:KEY}` vault entry. Prefer this. It is the only form gridctl can re-resolve later, so it is the only one where a private pack keeps updating after the first import.
- `--auth-token-stdin`: reads the token from stdin, keeping it out of shell history and out of the process list. `--auth-token -` does the same thing.
- `--auth-token <pat>`: an ephemeral HTTPS token, kept for CI ergonomics. Passing a literal value prints a warning, because the value lands in your shell history and is visible to anyone who can run `ps`.
- `--ssh-key <path>`: an SSH private key path. Set `GRIDCTL_SSH_KEY_PASSPHRASE` if the key is encrypted.

Only the reference is ever written to disk. A pack imported with `--vault-key GIT_TOKEN` records `${var:GIT_TOKEN}` in the import lockfile and in each resource's origin sidecar, never the token value, and a later `gridctl skill update` re-resolves it with nothing re-supplied. A pack imported with a literal or piped token records no reference at all, by design, so its next update falls back to ambient credentials.

Over REST, `POST /api/packs` and `POST /api/packs/preview` accept the same optional `auth` object the skill source endpoints take. Omit it on a repository that was already imported with a `--vault-key` reference and the stored reference is used automatically, which is how the web UI's update dialog previews a private pack without asking for anything.

### The daemon and ssh-agent

`gridctl apply` and `gridctl serve` daemonize by re-spawning with the environment of the shell that launched them, so the daemon has a usable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` only if that shell did, and a long-running daemon can outlive the agent it inherited. Every import driven from the web UI or the REST API runs in the daemon's environment, not in the shell of whoever is using the browser. If you rely on an agent, start it before the daemon and restart the daemon after restarting the agent.

gridctl does not read `~/.ssh/config`. Per-host `IdentityFile` entries have no effect, which is why an SSH URL that works with the `git` CLI can still fail here. For a private pack the dependable options are an HTTPS URL with `--vault-key`, or `--ssh-key` naming the key explicitly.

## Interplay with the standalone verbs

Packs add bookkeeping, not a second write path. `gridctl skill project sync`, `gridctl skill update`, and `gridctl project sync --kind wiring` keep working on pack-managed resources; a plain re-sync never strips the pack tag. One pack owns a resource at a time: applying a pack over a resource tagged by another pack refuses that resource until one manifest gives it up.

## REST and web UI

The full verb set is available over HTTP: `GET /api/packs` (list), `GET /api/packs/{name}` (detail with per-resource state rows), `POST /api/packs` (add from git, behind the same blocking security scan; also the update path against an already-imported origin), `POST /api/packs/preview` (read-only manifest resolution), `POST /api/packs/{name}/apply` (with `clients`, `force`, and `dry_run`, matching the CLI flags), and `DELETE /api/packs/{name}` (with a dry-run cascade preview). See the [API reference](api-reference.md#packs). The web UI's Library workspace surfaces installed packs in its Packs segment.

Status rows for rules report per-client projection state once a pack is applied (drift and staleness per fragment-file projection; a compiled client's whole-document state stays in `gridctl ctx status`), with a store-presence row for a rule that was imported but never projected.

## What packs deliberately do not have

No enable/disable state (imported and projected are the only states), no inter-pack dependencies, no interactive configuration prompts (secrets flow through the existing `${var:KEY}` vault mechanism), and no marketplace indirection (`pack add` points at a git repo you chose, with the same trust gate as `skill add`).
