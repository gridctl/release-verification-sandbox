# Python source containers

Gridctl can generate a container image for an exact public PyPI release or a
packaged Python project in a Git or local source. Docker or Podman performs the
build; host Python and uv are not required.

| Example | Use it to |
|---------|-----------|
| [`pypi.yaml`](pypi.yaml) | Try one generated server with the smallest useful stack |
| [`daily.yaml`](daily.yaml) | Run pinned PyPI and Git sources together |

## PyPI example

`pypi.yaml` builds `mcp-server-fetch==2026.8.18` from the official public PyPI
index. The package exposes one console script, so the server-level `command` can
be omitted. Generated Python servers default to stdio and do not publish a
port.

```bash
gridctl validate examples/python-sources/pypi.yaml
gridctl plan examples/python-sources/pypi.yaml --show-dockerfile
gridctl apply examples/python-sources/pypi.yaml
gridctl logs --server fetch
gridctl destroy examples/python-sources/pypi.yaml
```

The first apply resolves package metadata and builds a content-addressed image.
Later unchanged applies reuse the image when its build-input label matches.
The plan resolves the exact artifact, previews the generated Dockerfile, and
reports whether the resulting image is already cached.

## Daily topology

`daily.yaml` is a practical agent setup with two credential-free tools:

| Server | Source | Pin | Runtime behavior |
|--------|--------|-----|------------------|
| `fetch` | Public `mcp-server-fetch` release on PyPI | Exact package version | Fetches web content over the network |
| `time` | `src/time` in the official MCP servers Git repository | Full commit SHA | Answers time and timezone queries locally |

Both packages expose one console script, so neither server needs an explicit
`command`. Gridctl builds both as non-root stdio containers and publishes no
host ports.

```bash
gridctl validate examples/python-sources/daily.yaml
gridctl plan examples/python-sources/daily.yaml --show-dockerfile
gridctl apply examples/python-sources/daily.yaml
gridctl logs --server fetch
gridctl logs --server time
gridctl destroy examples/python-sources/daily.yaml
```

The first plan or apply needs network access to PyPI, GitHub, and the configured
container registry; later unchanged operations can reuse verified local images.

## Packaged git and local projects

For a packaged project in Git, set `runtime: python` and use `path` for a clean
subdirectory below the checkout:

```yaml
source:
  type: git
  url: https://github.com/example/mcp-monorepo.git
  ref: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
  path: services/weather
  runtime: python
```

For a local source, `path` remains the source root and `project_path` selects a
project below it:

```yaml
source:
  type: local
  path: ./mcp-monorepo
  project_path: services/weather
  runtime: python
```

Both forms require static package metadata in `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`.
Omit `dockerfile` to generate the image. Setting a non-empty `dockerfile`
explicitly selects that custom Dockerfile instead.

See the [Source schema](../../docs/config-schema.md#source) for Python version,
extras, additional dependencies, OS packages, command selection, and path
validation.
