// Package project is the generic projection engine behind pkg/skillsync,
// pkg/contexts, pkg/agentsync, and pkg/wiring: "project canonical content
// into per-client locations with lockfile-tracked ownership." The engine
// owns the unified lockfile (schema, two-tier versioning, migration from
// the legacy lockfiles, cross-process locking) and the shared vocabulary
// (states, dry-run actions, hash-scheme prefix, atomic writes, backup
// pruning).
//
// A kind yields a set of (source, target) projection keys: the contexts
// adapter records one source ("global") fanned to N clients (plus one
// source per fragment in fragments mode); the skills adapter records one
// source per projected skill. Everything the kinds do differently on
// purpose stays in the kind packages:
// target tables, channel/strategy resolution, hashing (tree vs content),
// backup placement, status enumeration mode, rendering, and remediation
// text. The engine deliberately does not force a uniform Target or a
// shared sync loop; the frozen CLI contracts are per-kind and the
// characterization tests in cmd/gridctl arbitrate.
