# 🎬 Contributing to Gridctl

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gridctl! This guide will help you get started.

## 📒 Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to be respectful and constructive.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.26 or later (the version in `go.mod`)
- **Node.js** 22 or later (the frontend is pinned to 22 via `.nvmrc` and `web/package.json` engines; tests do not start on 20)
- **Docker or Podman** (for running containers and integration tests)
- **Git** with commit signing configured
- **Task** (`brew install go-task/tap/go-task`, `npm install -g @go-task/cli`, or another [install method](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation))

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gridctl.git
   cd gridctl
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   task deps
   ```

3. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   task build
   ```

4. **Verify the build:**

   ```bash
   ./gridctl version
   ```

5. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   task test
   ```

### Build Commands

Tasks live in `Taskfile.yml`; `task --list` shows the full catalog. The most common:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `task build` | Build frontend and backend |
| `task build:web` | Build React frontend only |
| `task build:go` | Build Go binary only |
| `task dev` | Run Vite dev server for frontend development |
| `task test` | Run unit tests (race detector on, matching CI) |
| `task test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |
| `task test:frontend` | Run frontend tests (Vitest) |
| `task test:integration` | Run integration tests (requires Docker or Podman) |
| `task lint` | Lint backend (golangci-lint) and frontend (ESLint) |
| `task generate` | Regenerate mocks under `pkg/mcp/` and `pkg/runtime/` |
| `task clean` | Remove build artifacts |

> The `gridctl` binary on your `$PATH` is typically a released build. Test local changes with `task build` followed by `./gridctl …`.
>
> A transitional Makefile shim forwards the old `make <target>` names to their `task` equivalents.

## 🔧 Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Create a branch with a descriptive name using one of these prefixes:

| Prefix | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `feature/` | New functionality |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, CI, dependencies |

Example: `feature/add-ssh-transport` or `fix/container-timeout`

### Code Conventions

**Go:**
- Use standard library when possible
- Return errors instead of panicking
- Use `log/slog` for logging
- Pass `context.Context` for cancellation
- Write table-driven tests
- Define interfaces for external dependencies to enable mocking

**TypeScript/React:**
- Functional components with hooks
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Testing Requirements

- New functionality, features, and behavior changes must include tests - not just new exported functions
- Use the `TestFunctionName_Scenario` naming pattern
- Table-driven tests are preferred for multiple test cases
- Maintain existing coverage levels

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
task test                  # Unit tests
task test:integration      # Integration tests (requires Docker or Podman)
```

### Experimental Feature Flags

Risky or unfinished features ship dark behind a flag in the `pkg/flags`
registry, enabled per stack via the `experimental:` block in stack.yaml.
The registry is the single source of truth for what is experimental; the
user-facing flag table lives in `docs/config-schema.md` and must be updated
in the same PR as any registry change.

Lifecycle:

1. **Born experimental, off by default.** Register the flag with a
   `Description`, `Since` (the release introducing it), and `GraduatesBy`
   (the release by which a decision is forced). Name the flag in snake_case,
   spelled identically to the stable config key it will graduate to, so
   graduation is a promotion rather than a rename. Everything the flag
   gates must default to off (Article IX).
2. **Graduation.** Promote the behavior to a real config block (or make it
   unconditional), flip the registry entry's stage to graduated, and add a
   `Message` telling users what to do with the stale entry, naming the
   release the change shipped in (e.g. "graduated in 0.2.0; remove the
   entry, the feature is now always on"). A stack.yaml still setting the
   flag keeps working and warns with that message — never an error.
3. **Removal.** Two minor releases after graduation (or when an experiment
   is abandoned), flip the stage to removed. The entry stays in the
   registry forever: one map entry is the price of a specific migration
   message instead of a generic unknown-key warning.
4. **The graduation clock.** `TestNoBuiltinFlagOverdue` in `pkg/flags`
   fails when a flag's `GraduatesBy` is at or before the most recent
   release in CHANGELOG.md. Fix it by graduating the flag or by extending
   the deadline deliberately in a reviewed diff — flags never rot silently.

Every flag addition, graduation, and removal gets a CHANGELOG entry
(Article XV).

## 📋 Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <subject>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `style` - Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` - Adding or correcting tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf` - Performance improvement

**Rules:**
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep subject under 50 characters
- No period at the end

**Examples:**
- `feat: add SSH transport support`
- `fix: resolve container timeout on slow networks`
- `docs: update stack configuration examples`

### Commit Signing

All commits must be signed. If you haven't set up GPG signing, see [GitHub's guide on signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

## 📜 Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
3. **Run tests** and ensure they pass
4. **Push your branch** to your fork
5. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch

### PR Requirements

Your pull request should:
- Have a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Pass all CI checks (linting, tests, build)
- Add an entry under `[Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for any user-visible change
- Follow the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) checklist

[CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) is binding for every change and covers the rules that most often catch a refactor by surprise: test-first development, real dependencies in integration tests, no panics in `pkg/` or `internal/`, context propagation, stack YAML back-compat, and changelog discipline.

### CI Checks

Binary releases reuse these exact-commit gates before draft verification and publication. See [release verification and maintainer operations](docs/release-verification.md) for inventory scopes, credential boundaries, pin ownership, and recovery.

Pull requests are automatically checked for:
- Go linting (`golangci-lint` with `gosec`)
- Vulnerability scanning (`govulncheck`, `npm audit`)
- Unit tests with race detection, plus overall and per-package coverage thresholds
- Integration tests against both Docker and Podman
- Frontend type check, lint, tests, and build
- Example stack validation
- Successful binary build

## 🚧 Issue Guidelines

### Bug Reports

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1-bug-report.yml) and include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, version, etc.)

### Feature Requests

Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2-feature-request.yml) and include:
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered

Before opening an issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
